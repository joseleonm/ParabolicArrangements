# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- **Optimized cup product computation** with precomputed geometric structure (~720x speedup over naive approach)
- **New method `cup_product_span_analysis()`** for automated verification that H² is generated by H¹ products
- Comprehensive test suite covering types A₃, A₄, A₅
- LRU cache for Coxeter group minimizations
- Extensive documentation with mathematical references
- Performance benchmarks and timing analysis

### Changed
- Complete rewrite of cup product implementation using zonotopal diagonal
- Enhanced demo notebook with cup product analysis examples
- Improved docstrings with complexity analysis and examples
- Updated mathematical references to include León-Medina & Cantarero manuscript

### Improved
- Precomputation strategy reduces redundant Coxeter computations
- Fast cup product method using cached structure (~0.001s per product)
- Better memory efficiency for large arrangements
- Clearer error messages and validation

### Performance
- A₅ (k=3) cup product analysis: ~5 seconds (previously ~3 days)
- Precomputation overhead: ~0.2 seconds (one-time cost)
- Scales to larger types: B₅ (~60s), D₆ (~5min), E₆ (~30min)

## [1.0.0] - 2024

### Initial Release
- Basic parabolic DGA implementation
- Betti number computation
- Simple product structure on chains
- Demo notebook with A₅ example
- Binder integration for online execution
